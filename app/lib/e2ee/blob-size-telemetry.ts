/**
 * Capacity-cliff observability, as a pure decision so it can be tested
 * without an HTTP server or a 2 MiB buffer.
 *
 * PROTOCOL.md §8 states the problem plainly: one blob holds an account's
 * ENTIRE store, and daily food logging walks it toward the 2 MiB cap over
 * years. Gzip bought roughly an order of magnitude of headroom; it did not
 * remove the cliff, and the fix (chunked or per-entity blobs) is a protocol
 * version bump, not a patch.
 *
 * That fix must be started because a graph crossed a line, not because a user
 * filed a bug saying sync stopped working. So every push that crosses 80% of
 * the cap logs a warning naming the account and the byte count. The gap
 * between the first warning and the first hard `413` is months of daily
 * logging — the entire point is that it be visible for all of them.
