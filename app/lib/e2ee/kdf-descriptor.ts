/**
 * The per-account KDF descriptor — the non-secret Argon2id salt and cost
 * parameters a NEW device needs BEFORE it can log in, and the deterministic
 * dummy that keeps serving it from becoming an account-enumeration oracle.
 *
 * THE ENUMERATION PROBLEM, stated plainly: a zero-knowledge login requires
 * the client to derive its auth-hash before authenticating, which requires
 * the salt, which requires an UNAUTHENTICATED endpoint keyed by handle. Done
 * naively that endpoint answers "does this handle have an account?" for
 * anyone who asks.
 *
 * THE FIX (decided in the M128 counsel, not left residual): an unknown handle
 * gets a descriptor derived as `HMAC(enumerationSecret, handle)` — stable
 * across requests, indistinguishable from a real one, and produced by the
 * SAME function on the SAME code path with the SAME response shape. Stability
 * matters as much as shape: a random dummy would be distinguishable by asking
 * twice.
 *
 * What a dummy costs an attacker: they can still burn Argon2id at 64 MiB per
 * guess and get a login rejection. What it denies them: a cheap, silent,
 * unthrottleable list of which handles hold accounts.
 *
 * Pure module — no DB, no config, no clock.
