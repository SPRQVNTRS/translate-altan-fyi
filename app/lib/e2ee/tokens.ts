/**
 * Opaque-token primitives: minting, hashing, expiry and lifecycle
 * classification. PURE and DB-free by design (the only impurity is
 * `randomBytes`), so every rule below is unit-testable without a database —
 * the DB-touching orchestration lives in `server/auth-handlers.ts` over an
 * injected `AccountStore`.
 *
 * SECURITY MODEL — the reason these are opaque strings and not JWTs:
 *
 *  - A JWT is *stateless*, which is exactly the property this service must
 *    not have. Revocation is the load-bearing feature here: PROTOCOL.md
 *    requires that a passphrase change invalidates every outstanding session
 *    immediately. A stateless token can only be made to
 *    expire, never to stop working, without adding the same server-side
 *    denylist that a database-backed opaque token already is.
 *  - Only the SHA-256 digest of a token is persisted. A dumped
 *    `account_tokens` table therefore yields nothing replayable. SHA-256 with
 *    no stretching is correct here (unlike for passwords): the pre-image is
 *    256 bits of `randomBytes`, so there is no dictionary to run.
 *
 * ACCESS/REFRESH SPLIT (counsel decision, M128 spec 02): the client in a
 * zero-knowledge design must never cache the master passphrase, so it cannot
 * silently re-derive an auth-hash to log in again. A long-lived rotating
 * refresh token is what makes silent re-auth possible at all; the short-lived
 * access token is what limits the damage of one leaking.

 * mailer. A service that holds no address cannot send a link, and the mailed
 * link was an account-takeover path that bought no recovery — it restored a
 * LOGIN to data that stays sealed, because the server never held a key that
 * unwraps a DEK. `account_tokens` therefore holds sessions and nothing else.
