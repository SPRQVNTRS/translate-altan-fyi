/**
 * The Bitwarden-model authentication verifier — and the reason it is a FAST
 * keyed hash rather than another slow KDF.
 *
 * What the client sends as its "password" is already the output of
 * Argon2id → HKDF over the user's passphrase (PROTOCOL.md §3.1, the `auth`
 * branch). The expensive, memory-hard work has therefore already been paid,
 * on the client, once per login. Running a second slow hash here would add
 * **zero** brute-force resistance — an attacker who has the auth-hash has
 * already skipped Argon2id — while handing anyone a login-flood DoS: N
 * concurrent login attempts would each pin 64 MiB and a CPU core on the
 * server.
 *
 * So the stored verifier is `HMAC-SHA-256(pepper, authHash)`. That still
 * defeats the attack peppering is for: with the pepper held outside the
 * database (`SERVER_SECRET` in the environment), a dumped `accounts` table
 * cannot be replayed pass-the-hash style against a live instance, and its
 * verifiers cannot be checked offline against guessed auth-hashes.
 *
 * The server never sees, and cannot derive, anything that decrypts a blob:
 * the auth-hash and the passphrase-KEK are two independent HKDF branches off
 * the same Argon2id output, with different `info` labels.
 *
 * Pure module — no config, no DB, no env. Unit-tested directly.

 * `Bright-Otter` and `bright-otter` alike or the spelling itself becomes an
 * oracle.
 *
 * NFKC comes FIRST because compatibility composition is what folds the
 * look-alike forms Unicode offers for the same characters (fullwidth Latin,
 * ligatures, the non-breaking spaces a paste can carry). Trimming afterwards
 * catches the ASCII spaces NFKC produces from those; lowercasing last is what
 * makes the unique index a true case-insensitive guarantee.
