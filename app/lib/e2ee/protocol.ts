/**
 * The E2EE sync WIRE CONTRACT — the entire shared surface between an openplate
 * client and a sync service (M128 spec 01).
 *
 * THIS FILE IS MAINTAINED IN TWO REPOS AND MUST STAY IDENTICAL IN SUBSTANCE:
 *  - `openplate/app/lib/sync/engine/protocol.ts`   (the client half)
 *  - `openplate-sync/src/protocol.ts`              (this file — the service half)
 *
 * They are deliberately NOT a shared package: the two repos ship and version
 * independently, and a third party must be able to implement either side from
 * `openplate-sync/PROTOCOL.md` alone without depending on our code. The price
 * of that independence is hand-maintained duplication, so each repo carries a
 * unit test that asserts its local `PROTOCOL_VERSION` (and the size/retention
 * limits) against TRANSCRIBED literals — there is no shared CI, so drift has
 * to fail a test rather than rely on a promise in a doc comment
 * (`tests/unit/protocol.test.ts` here,
 * `tests/unit/sync-engine/protocol.test.ts` there).
 *
 * The service stores OPAQUE BYTES. It never sees a key, never parses an
 * envelope, and never learns anything about the plaintext beyond its length.
 * Everything below is therefore either transport framing or non-secret
 * metadata the service legitimately needs (versions, sizes, CAS tokens).
