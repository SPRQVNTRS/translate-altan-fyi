 * Domain-separated subkeys derived from the single operator-supplied

 *
 * WHY ONE ENV VAR AND NOT TWO: a self-hoster who has to generate, store and
 * rotate two independent secrets will eventually reuse one for the other, and
 * reusing a key across two unrelated HMAC purposes is exactly the mistake
 * domain separation exists to prevent. Deriving both from one root removes
 * the opportunity: they are unequal by construction, and neither can be
 * recovered from the other.
 *
 * The labels are frozen. Changing one is a breaking operational change:
 * `verifierPepper` feeds every stored account verifier (every account would
 * have to reset), and `enumerationSecret` feeds the dummy KDF descriptors
 * (a client mid-flight against a dummy would see the salt change).
